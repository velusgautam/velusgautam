### Hi there 👋

I'm a Web Engineer with 8 years of industry experience and I love JavaScript. 🤹🏼‍

My areas of interest are:

- 🔭 I’m currently work on libraries like React, Next.js, Sapper & Svelte
- 🌱 I’m currently learning languages Go & Rust (for WASM)
- 💚 I love doing JavaScript infrastructure tooling, frameworks and libraries
- 👯 I love open source collaboration on public repositories
- 💬 I share my ideas through my blog [Hectane.com](http://hectane.com/)
- ⚡ I learn from errors and keep doing experiments. 
- 🔥 I'm currently wobbling my head around Design Systems, Deno, WASM and Kubernetes
